-- | In general, a source represents a producer of a stream of data. A source
-- can either produce output, or indicate that there is no more data. This type
-- represents the output from a 'Source'.
data Stream a = EOF -- ^ no more data
              | Chunks [a] -- ^ produced some data

instance Functor Stream where
    fmap _ EOF = EOF
    fmap f (Chunks a) = Chunks (map f a)

-- | A 'Source' has two operations on it: pull some data, and close the
-- 'Source'. Since 'Source' is built on top of 'ResourceT', all acquired
-- resources should be automatically released anyway. Closing a 'Source' early
-- is merely an optimization to free scarce resources as soon as possible.
--
-- A 'Source' has two invariants:
--
-- * It is illegal to call 'sourcePull' after a previous call returns 'EOF'.
--
-- * It is legal to call 'sourceClose' multiple times.
--
-- 'Source's are not expected to call 'sourceClose' when they return an 'EOF'
-- from 'sourcePull', though based on the second invariant, they are free to do
-- so.

-- | All but the simplest of 'Source's (e.g., @repeat@ and @cycle@) require
-- some type of state to track their current status. This may be in the form of
-- a mutable variable (e.g., @IORef@), or via opening a resource like a
-- @Handle@. While a 'Source' is given no opportunity to acquire such
-- resources, this type is.
--
-- A 'SourceM' is simply a monadic action that returns a 'Source'. One nice
-- consequence of this is the possibility of creating an efficient 'Monoid'
-- instance, which will only acquire one resource at a time, instead of bulk
-- acquiring all resources at the beginning of running the 'SourceM'.
--
-- Note that each time you \"call\" a @SourceM@, it is started from scratch. If
-- you want a resumable source (e.g., one which can be passed to multiple
-- @Sink@s), you likely want to use a 'BSource'.

-- | When actually interacting with 'Source's, we usually want to be able to

--
-- A 'BSource', unlike a 'SourceM', is resumable, meaning it can be passed to
-- multiple 'Sink's without restarting.
--
-- Finally, a 'BSource' relaxes one of the invariants of a 'Source': calling
-- 'bsourcePull' after an 'EOF' will simply return another 'EOF'.
